# go-meetup

This is the result of a live-coding at a private meetup. The application uses the Rick and Morty API to retriev a number of random characters.<br />
To try it out, start the application (`startup.sh`) and run `http://localhost:8080/random-characters` and pass the query parameter `count` to specify the number of characters (1 - 50).

The application uses the following features:
- HTTP handlers
- Middleware functions
- HTML templates
- Channels
- Structured logging
